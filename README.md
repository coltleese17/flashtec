# flashtec

A contract invoicing demo app for Flashtec


To Build the project and run the tests run 
```
./gradlew clean build
```

To start the project run

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

To run the tests run

```
./gradlew test
```

I've attached a postman collection you can use to test the endpoints, I believe they straightforwardly map to the project description.

Due to time constraints I wasn't able to implement validation or user management, and only a few tests, though I would be happy to explain how I would approach
them with something like Spring Secruity or Shiro

Thank you for your time
